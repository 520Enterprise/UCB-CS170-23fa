    "\n",
    "To access flow from edge `(u, v)`, do `g.edges[u, v][\"flow\"]`; sub `flow` for `capacity` for capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access outgoing edges from `c` like adjacency list, do `g.edges(c)`. Note the returned type is an iterable of vertex tuples, so you should do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for u, v in g.edges(c):\n",
    "    e = g.edges[u, v]\n",
    "    print(e[\"flow\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "To update some edge $(u, v)$ to have flow of `f`, we can do either `g.add_edge(u, v, flow=f, capacity=c)` or `g.edges[u, v][\"flow\"] = f`, where `c` is the capacity of the edge - make sure you don't change edge capacities!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this coding HW, instead of decreasing `g.edges[u, v][\"capacity\"]` and check if it's still greater than zero each time you find or augment a path, please increase `g.edges[u, v][\"flow\"]` and check if it's still greater than `g.edges[u, v][\"capacity\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `g.edges[u, v]` looks like adjacency matrix it is not - if `(u, v)` doesn't exist there would be `KeyError`.\n",
    "Later, when implementing `edmonds_karp()`, you can use `nx.algorithms.flow.build_residual_network` to prevent `KeyError`s. `nx.algorithms.flow.build_residual_network` takes in an input graph and a key variable (for this assignment, the key will always be \"capacity\"), and returns a graph with 0-capacity edges placed wherever there is no edge in the input graph. For more information, see the [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.flow.build_residual_network.html)."
